Learning outcomes: 
At the end of this module, participants should be able to:

Evaluate physical layer security vulnerabilities (including wiretapping, sniffing, and jamming) and identify security controls for layer 1 security, which include physical access controls and monitoring
Evaluate Data Link layer security vulnerabilities (including ARP spoofing, MAC flooding, MiTM) and identify security controls for layer 2 security, which include VLANS, port security, DAI, DHCP snooping
Evaluate Network layer security vulnerabilities (including spoofing, DOS) and identify security controls for layer 3 security, which include ACLs, Firewalls, IPSec VPNs
Implement security controls including VLANs, switch port security, DHCP security, ACL, IPSec VPNs, and SSH using provided tools and lab scenarios
